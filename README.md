# odin-landing-page

Initial Creation Date 8/7/2024

The goal of this project was to create a landing page in the same style as the one found on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page. I was able to achieve this with a combination of flex-box techniques. Overall I'm very happy with the quality of the build, especially when comparing it to my previous Recipes project. It took me several hours but I understood the majority of the techniques used with minimal reference to prior exercises. The Odin Project continues to be an excellent method of learning web design and I'm excited to see what awaits me in the future!
